Docushare Index Table
*********************

When attempting to navigate the various documents hosted on Docushare it is
recommended that you begin here. As of now there is no method known to create
an index table at the root of a Docushare folder that can display the contents 
of the folder making navigation difficult. For this reason this index table is
created to make navigation of the TMA Docushare space simpler.
